**config**
Sets clipping plane to 20.

**ffxidb**
Positions the minimap to the left side of the screen. Its position is just high enough to not obstruct the lower left menus when maximized and low enough to not obstruct the equipment and auction house windows.

**init**
Disables fullbright mode and places the console flush with the top left corner.

**timers**
Disables all clocks except for recasts. Puts the recast timers just to the right of the macro menu when set to static.
