**ffxidb**

Positions the minimap to the right side of the screen. Its position is to the left of the party HP/MP bars. Looks the best if the text box has its width slightly reduced, so that the minimap fits in between the gap.


**init**

Disables fullbright mode and places the console flush with the top left corner.


**timers**

Disables all clocks except for recasts. Puts the recast timers just to the right of the macro menu when set to static.
